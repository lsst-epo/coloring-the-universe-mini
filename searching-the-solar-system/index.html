			<h3 class="mt-5 mb-4">Introduction</h3>
			<p>For hundreds of years we had a simple model of our Solar System: eight planets and their moons, and occasionally a passing comet. Then came the discovery of the first asteroid, Ceres, in 1801, an indication there was more going on out there than we thought. Sure enough, over the next 200 years about 800,000 small Solar System objects (which includes asteroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects) were discovered. At first the rate of discovery was slow, but advances in technology, which have made it possible to detect smaller and more distant objects, have sped up the process. </p>
			<p>The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is the most powerful observational tool we’ve ever had; the size of its mirrors and the sensitivity of its camera combine to help us see more objects in our Solar System than ever before. Each image taken by LSST covers a large area of the sky, and captures light even from very faint objects, making it possible to measure the motions of millions of small Solar System objects per night. Many of these are brand new discoveries. </p>
			<p>In this investigation, you will use real data from LSST to develop a deeper understanding of how small objects are distributed throughout the Solar System. You will also examine the orbits and characteristics of some newly detected Solar System objects, in order to classify them. Together, these observations will help us put together the story of how our Solar System formed, and give us insights into what we might find around other stars that have exoplanets. Once you’ve completed this investigation you will be able to answer the following Essential Questions:</p>
			<h3 class="mt-5 mb-4">Essential Questions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>What unique orbital properties exist among the different small objects in the Solar System?</li>
				<li>How can observations of small objects give us information about their sizes and compositions?</li>
				<li>What can observations of small objects reveal about the formation and history of the Solar System?</li>
			</ul>

			<b>Detecting Solar System objects</b>
			<p>Each night, LSST takes two images of the same star field, at least thirty minutes apart. The images are compared by computer software, and if anything has moved an alert is automatically generated, and the data sent to the <a href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/about">IAU Minor Planet Center</a> (MPC). Within hours, the MPC determines a preliminary orbit for the object.</p>

			<p>Below are some sample observations of moving Solar System objects. Observe how each object moves in relation to the star field. Each image is a 30-second exposure.</p>

			<b>Characterizing the orbit of a Solar System object</b>
			<p>To estimate the orbit of a newly discovered Solar System object, astronomers map its position and record the time it takes to travel from one place to another. By making a series of careful measurements, they can determine a preliminary orbit for the object. The orbit is mathematically expressed through a series of orbital elements. The ones used in this investigation are described below:</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_and_semi-minor_axes">semi-major axis</a> is half of the longest diameter of an ellipse. Simply put, this number indicates the size of the orbit. It is measured in <a href="https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/glossary/au.html">astronomical units</a> (AU).</p>

			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity">Eccentricity</a> is a mathematical way of describing how elliptical (i.e., oval shaped) an orbit is. Eccentricity values range from 0 to almost 1. An eccentricity of 0 describes a perfectly circular orbit. The larger the eccentricity, the more elliptical the orbit.</p>

			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination">Inclination</a> is the angle that the object’s orbital plane is tilted, relative to Earth’s orbital plane around the Sun. A value of 0° means that the orbit is parallel with Earth’s orbit. A value of 90° means that the orbit is tilted at a right angle to Earth’s orbit. Occasionally, a value between 90° and 180° is listed. These objects are in retrograde orbits around the Sun, orbiting in the opposite direction of most Solar System objects.</p>

			<b>The Big View of the Solar System</b>

			<p>LSST will discover millions of new Solar System objects, and will provide an enormous data set that gives us a more comprehensive view of the objects’ distribution. The more we identify and map the distribution of objects in our Solar System, the more we can learn about how it formed.</p>

			<img src="Fig5.jpg" alt="">
			<p class="credit">Fig. 5: Three objects in the Asteroid Belt, shown to scale. Image credit NASA/JPL.</p>

			<p>For the purposes of this investigation, we have divided the small Solar System objects into four categories:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt">Main belt asteroids</a> (MBAs) - Objects located from 2 to 4 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</li>
				<li><a href="https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/about/basics.html">Near-Earth objects</a> (NEOs) - Asteroids or comets whose orbit intersects the orbit of Earth.</li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object">Trans-Neptunian objects</a> (TNOs) - Objects that orbit the Sun, at or beyond the orbit of Neptune, at a distance of about 30 AU and beyond. This area includes the Kuiper Belt and the entire region out to the inner Oort Cloud, which begins at approximately 2000 AU from the Sun.</li>
				<li>Comets - Icy objects found throughout the Solar System.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Now you’ll use a data visualization tool called the Orbit Tracker to explore the positions and orbital characteristics of some small Solar System objects. All of the displayed points and their motions represent the positions and behavior of real objects that have previously been discovered.</p>

			<p>Begin by selecting all objects and setting the view to fully zoomed out, then zoom in as necessary to explore. Experiment with changing the view of the Solar System orbits. Notice that you can change the view to above or below the Sun, as well as along the plane of the Solar System (as if you were a planet orbiting the Sun).</p>

			<ol start="3">
				<li>Observe the orbits of the objects and describe what is similar and what is different about these objects.</li>
				<textarea class="form-control" rows="1" placeholder="Similarities..."></textarea>
				<br>
				<textarea class="form-control" rows="1" placeholder="Differences..."></textarea>
			</ol>


			<p>Next, take time to examine each group of objects individually by selecting the object type in the Orbitmaster and paying attention to the four orbital characteristics listed below. Decide which of the statements provided below best describes each group’s orbital characteristics. Use the provided statements to complete the table in question 4.</p>

				</ul>
				<li>Size of the orbit</li>
				<ul>

				</ul>
				<li>Direction of the orbit</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Most objects orbit the Sun in the same direction as Earth’s orbit</li>
					<li>Many objects orbit the Sun in the opposite to the direction of Earth’s orbit</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<ol start="5">
				<li>According to Kepler's Third Law, and the information you recorded in your table, which of the four types of objects will have orbital periods shorter than Jupiter and which will be longer than Jupiter?</li>

			<p>In order to see general trends more clearly, it’s helpful to work with a large data set. Although your eyes can discriminate differences among a few hundred objects, it’s not possible to do so when the numbers get much larger. Plots are useful tools for examining larger data sets.</p>

		<b>The History of the Solar System</b>
		<p>According to the Solar Nebula Theory, a spinning cloud of dust and gas collapsed and the young Sun began to form at the center, while dusty and icy objects began to grow by repeated collisions with each other in a flattened accretion disk surrounding the Sun.</p>

		<img src="Fig7.jpg" alt="">
		<p class="credit">Fig. 7: This artist's concept shows a very young star encircled by a disk of gas and dust. The Solar Nebula Theory predicts an accretion disk such as this where Solar System objects would form. Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech.</p>
	
		<p>There is significant evidence to support this theory. Observations of star-forming regions reveal similar accretion disks around young stars in other parts of the galaxy. Another piece of evidence that supports the theory is the the fact that rocky planets formed close to the Sun and icy planets formed at greater distances. This can be explained by the higher temperatures closer to the Sun, which prevented the inner planets from retaining most of their original atmospheres and ices.</p>

		<p>We can also find evidence to support the Solar Nebula Theory by studying the motions of objects within the Solar System. To collect this evidence, we’ll go back to the Orbit Tracker and look for overall patterns in the way objects orbit the Sun. Use your completed chart and the visualization to answer these questions:</p>

		<ol start="9">
			<li><select class="custom-select my-1 mr-sm-2 student-answer-inline">
					<option selected>Choose ...</option>
    				<option value="1">Nearly all</option>
    				<option value="2">Roughly half</option>
				</select> of Solar System objects orbit in the same direction around the Sun
			</li>
			<li>If the direction of an object’s orbit were random, there would be a 50/50 chance that two objects would travel around the Sun in the same direction. Do the orbits you observe appear to be the result of random chance? If not, what might explain their motions and orientation?</li>
			<textarea class="form-control" rows="1"></textarea>
		</ol>

		<p>Although the orbital motions of all of the major planets support the Solar Nebula Theory, many of the small Solar System objects have very eccentric or highly inclined orbits, and some even orbit the Sun in the opposite direction as the planets. We can apply Newton’s Laws to help explain these observations: </p>

		<ol start="11">
			<li>Imagine a close encounter in space between two objects, one with a large mass, and one with a small mass. As the objects approach each other, the forces they exert on each other must be equal according to Newton’s Third Law. Which object would experience a greater acceleration? Hint: think about Newton’s Second Law (Force = mass X acceleration).</li>
			<select class="custom-select my-1 mr-sm-2">
    			<option selected>Choose ...</option>
    			<option value="1">The more massive object would be accelerated more</option>
    			<option value="2">The less massive object would be accelerated more</option>
    			<option value="2">Both objects would experience the same acceleration</option>
  			</select>
		</ol>

		<p>These interactions are orchestrated by the big player in this story, gravity. Although the Sun is the dominant mass of the Solar System, local gravitational interactions play a role as well. From the early days of the Solar System to the present time, there have been many such interactions between objects. Complete the statement below to summarize what happens during these encounters: </p>

		<ol start="12">
			<li>Close encounters between small Solar System objects can result in changes in their orbits. The ___ the mass of an object, the ___ likely a close encounter will change the object’s orbital characteristics, such as  ____ and ____. In addition to mass, the distance between the two objects is a factor. Objects that are more widely separated are ___ likely to experience a change in their orbits as a result of a close encounter.</li>
		</ol>
