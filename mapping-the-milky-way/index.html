			<h3 class="mt-5">Introduction</h3>
			<p>We live inside a galaxy called the “Milky Way.”  Our galaxy contains over 400 billion stars and we now have a good idea of its size and shape as well as our location within it.  Our galaxy is too big to travel outside of it to take a picture.  So how can we know what our galaxy looks like when we are inside it? </p>
			<p>Imagine you lived in a house and you wanted to know what it looks like but you can’t go outside.  You could get a good idea by looking around your house and seeng where and how big the rooms are.  You could then look out the windows at other houses and see if any look similar to what you think your house looks like.
			</p>
			<p>We can figure out what the Milky Way looks like in a similar way: by mapping out the locations of stars inside our galaxy and by comparing the shape and size of our galaxy to other galaxies.
			</p>
			<p>In this investigation you will learn how to use LSST data to determine what kind of galaxy we live in. You’ll also learn how to figure out where in the Milky Way we live. We can learn both by mapping the locations of stars in the sky.
			</p>
			<h3 class="mt-5">Essential Questions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>What is a concentration map and how is it different from a map of stars?
				</li>
				<li>What kind of galaxy is the Milky Way? What is the evidence for this?
				</li>
				<li>Where are Earth and our Sun located in the Milky Way galaxy? What is the evidence for this?</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="mt-5">How to Map the Night Sky
			</h3>
			<p>LSST will measure the locations of about 17 billion stars in about a third of the entire sky.  It would be impossible to display all of the stars on a computer screen, so instead we will use a data visualization that shows the concentration of stars at different locations in the sky. Concentration maps show the number of stars in each location by displaying different colors on the map. Examine the color band at the map bottom: e.g., a red color indicates a high concentration of stars whereas black indicates there are no stars at that location.  White areas of the map are places that LSST has not observed.

			<p>If a location appears green, how many stars are located there?</p>
			
			<p> Why are some locations white?  Does this mean there are no stars at that location?</p>
			
			<p>Note that the concentration map may be for different types of objects.  For example, a map may show only the number of red stars at each location.</p>
			<p>Let’s practice using this type of map. A concentration map for stars detected through the LSST y-band filter will appear in the display window of the tool. The y-band filter passes infrared light from stars. Infrared light is not blocked by dust clouds, so we can see more of the stars than those that appear only in visible light.  Click and drag to move around in the display window until you find a location that appears red.   </p>
			<p> Predict whether you will see a large number of stars or few stars in the LSST image for this location.</p>
			
			<p>Click on a red location in the map.</p>
			<p>Close the image window.  Now move around in the display window until you find a location that appears blue.  </p>
			<p> Predict whether you will see a large number of stars or few stars in the LSST image for this location.</p>
			
			<p>Click on a blue location and an image of that region of the sky will appear. </p>
			<p> Based on what you have just observed, what do the colors on the concentration maps represent?</p>
			
			<h3 class="mt-5">What kind of galaxy is the Milky Way? Where Do We Live in Our Galaxy?</h3>
			<p>The distribution of stars in the sky would change depending on the type of galaxy you live in and your location in the galaxy.  To understand how this works we will investigate six simulated galaxy maps, using  two galaxy types and three locations in each galaxy.  As you explore these scenarios, think about how they are similar and different.  Specifically, keep these three questions in mind for each of the six scenarios:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Is there a band of color that indicates a high concentration of stars across the map?
				</li>
				<li>Is there a single location on it that has the highest concentration of stars?
				</li>
				<li>Are there regions of the map where there are no stars at all?
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Begin by imagining that you are at the center of an elliptical galaxy.</p>
		</div>
		<img src="" alt="">
		<div class="container">
			<p>Use the mapper tool to look around the sky.  Notice that the concentration of stars is the same no matter in what direction you look.
			</p>
			<p>  If you are living at the center of an elliptical galaxy, why does the distribution of stars look the same in all directions?</p>
			
			<p>Now imagine you are in the same galaxy as above but you’ve moved from the center of the galaxy to a location that’s halfway between the center and the outer edge, as shown below:
			</p>
		</div>
		<img src="" alt="">
		<div class="container">
			<p>  How does the distribution of stars look different than when you were located at the center of the galaxy?</p>
			
			<p>  Notice there is a direction in the sky where the concentration of stars is highest.  In what direction is this?  </p>
			
			<p>Now imagine you have moved to the outer edge of the galaxy, as shown below:</p>
		</div>
		<img src="" alt="">
		<div class="container">
			<p>Use the mapper tool to look around the sky again.</p>
			<p>  Notice that much of the sky does not contain any stars.  Why is that?</p>
			
			<p>  NHow is the distribution of stars different than for the previous two locations?</p>
			
			<p>Now imagine that you are at the center of a spiral galaxy.</p>
			<p>Like before, use the mapper tool to look around the sky.</p>
			<p>How does the distribution of stars look different than when you were at the center of an elliptical galaxy?</p>
			<p>Now imagine you are at a point halfway between the center of the galaxy and the edge:</p>
			<p>Use the mapper tool to look around the sky.</p>
			<p>In what direction is the concentration of stars the highest?  (Hint:  Think about the previous examples with the elliptical galaxy.)</p>
			<p>Finally, imagine you’re located at the outer edge of a spiral galaxy:</p>
			<p>Use the mapper tool to look around the sky again.</p>
			<p>Why does much of the sky not have any stars in it?</p>
			<p>How is the distribution of stars in this example different from the previous two locations in the spiral galaxy?</p>
			<p>For each of the six scenarios answer the three questions below by filling out the table. Write yes or no in each box:</p>
			<ol start="4">
				<li>Is there a band of color that indicates a high concentration of stars across the map?</li>
				<li>Is there a single location that has the highest concentration of stars?</li>
				<li>Are there regions of the map where there are no stars at all?</li>
			</ol>
			<table >
				<tr>
					<th></th>
					<th>Band of Color?</th>
					<th>Single location with highest concentration?</th>
					<th>Region with no stars?</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Elliptical - Center</td>
					<td>no</td>
					<td>no</td>
					<td>no</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Elliptical – Halfway</td>
					<td>no</td>
					<td>yes</td>

				<tr>
					<td>Elliptical – Edge</td>

			<h3 class="mt-5">Procedure: Using the LSST Data of our galaxy</h3>
			<p>One of these six scenarios above accurately describes where we live in the Milky Way Galaxy. To determine which one is right you will compare the simulated galaxy maps to the actual star concentration map of our Milky Way Galaxy created from LSST observations. Using the LSST star concentration map will be more challenging for two reasons: (1) Our galaxy is more complicated than the simulated galaxies you just studied.  It is not symmetrical, and it contains dust that can block starlight. (2) LSST won’t observe all of the Milky Way Galaxy. The areas of the galaxy that are not observed by LSST are shown as white.</p>
			<p>Explore the MIlky Way star concentration map as you did for the model galaxy maps. Like you did for the simulated maps, answer these three questions about the LSST map:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Is there a band of color that indicates a high concentration of stars across the map?</li>
				<li>Is there a single location that has the highest concentration of stars?</li>
				<li>Are there regions of the map where there are no stars at all?</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 class="mt-5">Analysis</h3>
			<p> Using your answers for these three questions, which of the six simulated maps most closely matches the appearance of the LSST map?</p>
			<p>From your previous answer, which kind of galaxy do you think the Milky Way is?</p>
			<p>Where do you think we are located in the galaxy?  (Center, edge, or halfway in between?)</p>
			<p>Turn on the constellations overlay. In the direction of which constellation is the center of our galaxy?  (If you think we are at the center, say that instead.)</p>
			<p> Could you have answered the above questions if LSST only covered a small part of the sky? Why or why not?</p>
			<h3>Discuss and report</h3>
			<p>Take a few minutes with your partner or group to discuss the following questions. Be prepared to share your observations with the class.</p>
			<h3 class="mt-5">Summary</h3>
			<p>Write a summary statement that explains what you have learned about the Milky Way galaxy and Earth’s position in it.</p>
