			<h3 class="mt-5 mb-4">Introduction</h3>

			<p>We live inside a galaxy called the Milky Way. Our galaxy contains over 400 billion stars, and we now have a good idea of its size and shape as well as our location within it. But how do we know this? The Milky Way is too big for us to send a space probe outside the galaxy to photograph it in its entirety. We need to use different techniques to figure out what it looks like from our place inside the galaxy.</p>

			<p>Imagine you live in a house, and you want to know what it looks like, but you can’t go outside. You could build a model of it by observing the inside of your house and noting the layout and size of the rooms. You could then look out the windows at other houses, to see if any of them have a similar appearance to the model of your house.</p>

			<p>We can figure out what the Milky Way looks like in a similar way: by mapping the locations of stars inside our galaxy, and by comparing the shape and size of our galaxy to other galaxies we can observe from a distance. Galaxies, like houses, come in different shapes and sizes. The most common galaxy types are <a href="https://cnx.org/contents/LnN76Opl@13.154:IwGwW2LK@3/Types-of-Galaxies">spiral, elliptical, and irregular galaxies.</a></p>

			<p>In this investigation you will learn how to use LSST data to determine the type of galaxy we live in. You’ll also learn how to figure out where in the Milky Way we live. We can do both by mapping the locations of stars in the sky.</p>

			<h3 class="mt-5 mb-4">Essential Questions</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>What is a concentration map and how is it different from a map of stars?
				</li>
				<li>What type of galaxy is the Milky Way? What is the evidence for this?
				</li>
				<li>Where are Earth and our Sun located in the Milky Way galaxy? What is the evidence for this?</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="mt-5 mb-4">Background</h3>

			<b>Understanding Concentration Maps</b>	

			<p>The map below shows a small section of the sky observed by LSST. Begin by selecting the star field image.</p>

			<img src="assets/Concentration Map/density-map.png" class="density-map" alt="">
			<img src="assets/Concentration Map/data-map.png" class="density-map data-map" id="data-map" alt="">
			<input type="range" class="density-map-opacity range" min="0" max="100" step="1" value="100" onchange="changeOpacity(this.value)">


			<p>When there are lots of stars in an image, it becomes impossible to quantify exactly how many stars are in a particular area just by looking at it. Since LSST will precisely map the locations of about 17 billion stars during its ten-year survey, it will definitely be impossible to count them visually. Instead, astronomers create data visualizations, called concentration maps, to show how many stars are concentrated at different locations in the sky. </p>
			<p>Now select the concentration map for this image.</p>
			<p>The different colors in the concentration maps give you an indication of how many stars are present in that area of the galaxy. Examine the color legend at the map bottom: e.g., a red color indicates a high number of stars concentrated in that area, whereas black indicates there are no stars at that location. White areas of the map are places where LSST has not observed the sky.</p>

				 number of stars in that area.</li>
				
				<li>Why are some regions white? Does this mean there are no stars in those places?

				</li>
				<li>Find a red area on the map. Predict whether there is a large number of stars or a small number of stars in this area.

  				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Click on the red area on the map. An image of that region of the galaxy will appear. Note the number of stars in this image.</p>

			<b>Concentration Map Models</b>

			<p>The distribution of stars you see in the sky depends on the type of galaxy you live in and your location within it. If the Milky Way had a different shape or if the Sun were in a different location, you would see the stars distributed in the sky in a different way. To understand how this works you will investigate six concentration maps for simulated galaxies, using two galaxy types (elliptical and spiral) and three locations in each galaxy. </p>

			<p> As you explore these six scenarios, think about what is similar and what is different about the concentration and distribution of stars in each type of galaxy. Specifically, keep these three questions in mind for each scenario:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Is there a band of color that indicates a high concentration of stars across the map?</li>
				<li>Is there a place that has the highest concentration of stars?</li>
				<li>Are there regions of the map where there are very few (or no) stars?</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Begin by selecting “Elliptical Galaxy - Edge” from the drop-down menu on the sky mapper.</p>

			<p>As you move around the map, notice the small index image in the lower right corner. An arrow extends from your location in the galaxy, pointing in the direction that you are viewing. </p>

			<p>Imagine you are located on a planet orbiting a star at the edge of an elliptical (spherical) galaxy. </p>

			<p>Click and drag to explore the concentration map of stars from this location. </p>

			<ol start="6">
				<li>Describe what you see.
				<textarea class="form-control" rows="3"></textarea>
				</li>
				<li> Notice that much of the sky does not contain any stars. In which direction are you looking when you observe this? (Refer to the index image when you see this view.)

			</ol>

			<p>Change the menu on the sky mapper to “Elliptical Galaxy - Halfway.”</p>

			<p>Now imagine you are in the same galaxy as before, but you’ve moved to a location that’s halfway between the center and the outer edge.</p>

	  				</select>
  				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Change the menu on the sky mapper to “Elliptical Galaxy - Center.”</p>

			<p>Notice as you look around the sky that that the concentration of stars is the same in every direction you look. </p>

			<p>Now let’s investigate the views of the sky from a spiral galaxy.</p>

			<p>Change the menu on the sky mapper to “Spiral Galaxy - Edge.”</p>

			<ol start="12">

			<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Using the LSST data for our galaxy</h3>
			<p>One of the six scenarios above accurately models what type of galaxy the Milky Way is, and where we live in it. To determine which one it is, you will compare the simulated concentration maps to the actual star concentration map of the Milky Way Galaxy created from LSST observations. Studying the LSST star concentration map will be more challenging for two reasons: (1) Our galaxy has more complex structure than the simulated galaxies you just studied. (2) LSST can’t observe all of the sky, only what is visible from its location in the Southern hemisphere. The areas of the sky that are not observed by LSST are shown as white.</p>

			<p>The Milky Way concentration map is made from the number of stars that appear in y-band filter images. The y-band filter allows LSST to observe infrared light from stars. Since infrared light is not blocked by dust clouds, the y-band filter allows us to see more stars than we would observe by using only visible light wavelengths.</p>

			<ol start="16">
